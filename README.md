Running the code for this project requires the installation of a Python distribution and the modules scikit-learn and scikit-neuralnetwork.

For Mac, you can install scikit-learn and scikit-neuralnetwork if you have Python already installed by entering
	pip install -U numpy scipy scikit-learn
and
	pip install scikit-neuralnetwork
into the terminal.

Place the python file into the same directory as the datasets, then edit the code in the way I've specified in the comments and run it.
